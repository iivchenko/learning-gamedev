# learning-gamedev
A set of different experiments to learn math, ai, physics, game design etc. using MonoGame framework

# Experiments 
## Experiment 0001

This expriment is a practice of Kinematic movement algorithms (Wander, Seek, Flee). It is a primitive life simulation. There are predators, herbivores and plants. Predators and herbivores Wander around until the see food or enemy.
