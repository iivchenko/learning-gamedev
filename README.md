# TODO:
- Add some 8-bit music for fun
- Implement game 'Life'

# Experiments 
## Experiment 0001

This expriment is a practice of Kinematic movement algorithms (Wander, Seek, Flee). It is a primitive life simulation. There are predators, herbivores and plants. Predators and herbivores Wander around until the see food or enemy.
